                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                                    COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                                    Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals
                                    and then spread to people. More information about the <span>source and spread of
                                        COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the

                                <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first
                                    infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                                    person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on
                                    a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses
                                    are less so.</p>
                                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the
                                    community (“community spread”) in <span>some affected geographic areas.</span>
                                    Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area,
                                    including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>

                                    Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is
                                    why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                                    (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of
                                    infecting others.</p>
                                <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone
                                    from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors,
                                    infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves
                                    considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs
                                    and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
                                <p>Current <span>CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</span>
                                    is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following

                                <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
                                <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>
                                <p>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens
                                    collected at least 24 hours apart.</p>
                                <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of

                                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                    Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                    going to the bathroom.</p>
                                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
                                    over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                                    seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is
                                    happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that
                                    impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school
                                    dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school
                                    dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare
                                    arrangements, if needed.</p>
                                <p>If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or
                                    school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do
                                    from home to keep up with their schoolwork.</p>
                                <p>Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is

                                <p>Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions
                                    to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local
                                    media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your
                                    child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff

                                <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                    respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                    Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                    going to the bathroom.</p>
                                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
                                    over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                                    is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to

                                    measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to
                                    protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing
                                    this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could

                                    diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C,
                                    regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect
                                    yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with
                                    alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.</p>

                                    bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful,
                                    as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by
                                    frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on

                                    coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory
                                    virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person
                                    coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To
                                    protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
                                    them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and

                                <p>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself
                                    against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an
                                    alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are
                                    cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.
